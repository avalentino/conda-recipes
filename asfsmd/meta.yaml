  summary: 'ASF Sentinel-1 Metadata Download tool'
  description: |
    Small Python tool (`asfsmd`) that allows to download XML files containing
    Sentinel-1 products metadata from the ASF archive.

    Sentinel-1 products are stored in the ASF arcive as ZIP files that are
    quite large because they contain both the products annotations and the
    binary image data.

    The `asfsmd` tool is able to retrieve only the relatively samll annotation
    files (in XML format) without downloading the entire ZIP archive.

    `asfsmd` exploits Python packages like `fsspec` or `httpio` for reading HTTP 
    resources as random-access file-like objects. In order to do it the remote 
    server must support the `Range` header.

    This approach allows to open the ZIP archive remotely, inspects contents, and
    download only the pieces of data that are actually necessary to the user.

    Performnces of this approach are quite poor but, in the specific case of
    Sentinel-1 products, the entire process results to be faster than downloading
    the entire ZIP archive and extracting only annotation files.
