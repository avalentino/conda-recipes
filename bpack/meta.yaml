  summary: 'Binary data structures (un-)packing library'
  description: |
    The bpack Python package provides tools to describe and encode/decode
    binary data.

    Binary data are assumed to be organized in *records*, each composed by a
    sequence of fields. Fields are characterized by a known size, offset
    (w.r.t. the beginning of the record) and datatype.

    The package provides classes and functions that can be used to:

    * describe binary data structures in a declarative way (structures can
      be specified up to the bit level)
    * automatically generate encoders/decoders for a specified data descriptor

    Encoders/decoders (*backends*) rely on well known Python packages like:

    * struct (form the standard library)
    * bitstruct (optional)
    * numpy (optional)
    * bitarray (optional) - partial implementation
