  summary: 'Python ENVISAT Product Reader API'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended
  description: |
    PyEPR provides Python bindings for the ENVISAT Product Reader C API
    (EPR API) for reading satellite data from ENVISAT ESA (European Space
    Agency) mission.
    PyEPR, as well as the EPR API for C, supports ENVISAT MERIS, AATSR
    Level 1B and Level 2 and also ASAR data products. It provides access to
    the data either on a geophysical (decoded, ready-to-use pixel samples)
    or on a raw data layer. The raw data access makes it possible to read
    any data field contained in a product file.
